Longest Common Subsequence

Problem Description

Given two strings A and B. Find the longest common subsequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous), 
which is common in both the strings.

You need to return the length of such longest common subsequence.



Problem Constraints
1 <= Length of A, B <= 1005



Input Format
First argument is a string A.
Second argument is a string B.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the length of the longest common subsequence.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "abbcdgf"
 B = "bbadcgf"
Input 2:

 A = "aaaaaa"
 B = "ababab"


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The longest common subsequence is "bbcgf", which has a length of 5.
Explanation 2:

 The longest common subsequence is "aaa", which has a length of 3.
